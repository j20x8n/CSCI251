Assignment 1 
Aim 
The objectives of this assignment includes:
·Learning about procedural programming,control structures,arrays,dynamic memory   allocation   and   handling   input/output
● Apply   the   concepts   learnt   by   developing   a   Weather   Information   Processing   System
Background 
Your    software    company,Virtual    Solutions,has    just    won    a    $1m    contract    to    design    a    build    a   prototype Weather   Information   Processing System   (WIPS).For   this   assignment,you   take   on   the   role   of   a   software   architect.You   are   supplied   with   sample   input   weather   data(kindly   provided   by   the   meteorological   station),and   you   need   to   develop   a   program that does   the   following:
1)            read   in and   process a   configuration   file
2)            display   city   map
3)          display   cloud   coverage   map(cloudiness   index)
4)          display   cloud   coverage   map   (LMH   symbols)
5)          display   atmospheric   pressure   map(pressure   index)
6)          display   atmospheric   pressure   map   (LMH   symbols)
7)          show   weather   forecast   summary   report
The    program    should    be    compiled    as    'csci251_a1.exe'and    run    in    Ubuntu      14.04      (Linux    OS).   The   next section describes the   requirements for the   program.
Task Requirements 
A)Upon    startup,the      program    should       prompt      user    to      enter    a      'configuration'filename.The   program   then   proceeds   to   read   the   contents   (of   the   entered   filename)to   further   initialize   its      own      program      parameters      /data      structures.Please      refer      to      Appendix       A,which         provides details on the configuration file and   its   usage.
B)The    meteorological    station    has    adopted      a      map-grid      coordinate      system      upon    which      it   overlays   all   other   weather   data.With   regards   to display city    map option,please   refer   to   Appendix       B,    which    elaborates    on      this      coordinate      system,the      unit      representation,the   relative   positioning of different cities and   its display   requirements.
C)For   the   display   requirements   of cloud    coverage(cloudiness    index),AND cloud       coverage (LMH    symbols)(i.e.options          3)4)),please          refer       to          Appendix       C,which       will       discuss   about   the   interpretation   of   cloud   cover   input   data,its   subsequent   processing   algorithm   and   output   fomat   requirements.
D)For   the   display   requirements   of atmospheric    pressure(pressure    index)AND atmospheric pressure(LMH          symbols) (i.e.options       5)6)),please       refer       to       Appendix       D,which             wil   discuss      about      the      interpretation      of      pressure      input      data,its      subsequent      processing   algorithm   and   output   fomat   requirements.
E)For      the      display      requirements      of      weather      forecast      summary      report,please      refer      to Appendix E,which   will   provide   details   about   the   kind   of   summarized   weather   data   to   be   displayed,processing    algorithm    to      compute      the       probability    of      rain      and       its    graphical   display format.
F)Refer   to Appendix F,for   a   description   of the   program's   main   menu   requirements
G)Once      the       program       is       completed       and       tested       to         be       working       successfully,you       are   encouraged   to   add   on   "new   features"to   the   program   that   you   feel   are   relevant   to   the   problem.Additional   marks   may   be   awarded   subject   to   the   relevancy   and   correctness   of   the    new    代 写CSCI251 Advanced Programming Assignment 1C/C++
代做程序编程语言functionalities.(Note       :the    additional    features    will      only      be      considered       IF    the   program      has      correctly    fulfilled    all      the       basic       requirements    elaborated       in    the       earlier   sections!)
H)You   are not allowed to    declare    your    own    C++classes    for    this    program,as    this      is      a   purely   procedural   (not   Object   Oriented)programming   assignment!
l)You   are   to   use   only   C++language   to   develop   your   program.There   is   no   restriction   on   the   IDE as long as your source files can   be compiled by    g++compiler (that   comes   installed   in   Tutor's   Ubuntu   Linux)and executed in the Ubuntu teminal shell environment.
Deliverables 
1)                   The   deliverables   include the   following:
a) The          actual          working          C++program(soft          copy), with       comments       on       each file, function    or    block    of    code to help the tutor understand its purpose. 
b) A   softcopy   word   document   that   elaborates   on:
●   (Interpreted) requirements of the program
● Diagram / Illustrations of program design 
● Summary of implementation of each module in your program 
● Reflections on program development (e.g. assumptions made, difficulties faced, what could have been done better, possible enhancements ind future, what have you learnt, etc) 
c)A    program    demo/software    testing    during      lab    session.You      must      be      prepared      to   perform   certain   tasks/answer   any   questions   posed   by   the   tutor.
2)                   IMPT:Please follow closely,to    the    submission    instructions    in Appendix    G, which      contains   details   about   what   to   submit,file   naming   conventions,when   to   submit,where   to      submit,etc.
3)                   The   software   demo   /testing   will   be   held   during   lab   session   where   you   are   supposed   to      submit      your      assignment.Some      time      will      be      allocated      for      you      to      present      /   demonstrate your program's capabilities during   the session.
Grading 
Student's deliverable will   be graded according to the following   criteria:
(i)                   Program fulfills   all the   basic   requirements   stipulated   by   the   assignment
(ii)                Successful    demonstration    of    a    working    program,clarity    of   explanation   /presentation   and   satisfactory   answers   provided   during   QA   session.
(ii)                Additional    effort(e.g.enhancing    the      program    with relevant features   over   and   above   task             requirements,impressive,‘killer'presentation)
(iv)             After    the    submission    of    deliverables,students    will    be    required      undergo      a      software   testing          process          (to         detemine         the         correctness         and         fulfillment         of       software   requirements.)Further   instructions   will   be   given   by   the   Tutor   during   the   subsequent   respective   labs.Please   pay   attention   as   failure   to   adhere   to   instructions   will   result   in   deduction   of   marks.
Tutor's note: In      the       real      working      world,satisfactory       completion       of      your       tasks       is       no       longer       enough.The      capability,efficiency   and    robustness   of   your   system   to   operate   under   different   testing   conditions,   and   the   ability   to add    value, communicate and/or demonstrate your    ideas   with   clarity   is   just   as   important      as      correct    functioning      of    your       program.The      grading      criteria       is      set    to       imitate      such   requirements    on      a'smaller      scale'.
